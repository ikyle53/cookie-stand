                <h3>Fresh Ingredients</h3>
                <p>Our ingrediants are made from organic farms in our local area from using free trade methods.
                The wheat that supplies our flour is sourced, ground, processed, and packages all in the northwest. 
                All of our fish ingredients are caught from the wild by local fishers. Everything is sourced from
                locals and not a big corporation.</p>
